<h2>It’s no secret that Princess Diana was a major style icon—and remains one to this day.<br> Her style influenced onlookers in the 1980s and 1990s, and continues to be an inspiration to fashionistas long after her tragic death. </h2>
<p >Never one to shy away from a style, Princess Diana braved a smorgasbord of trends that would<br> no doubt be deemed inappropriate for the Duchess of Cambridge to wear today, such is the new unspoken royal dress code.</p>
